# About
The algorithm is implemented according to the book "Introduction to Data Mining (Second Edition)" by Pang-Ning Tan.<br>
<br>

# Steps To Use
<h2>View the attached dataset named "heart_disease.csv" for a better understanding.</h2>
<br>
<ol>
<li>The target or dependent column name must end with the suffix "_T".<br>For example, if in a dataset the target variable column name is "gender", then it will be changed to "gender_T".<br>Changes should be made by the user to the dataset before using it with the script.</li>
<li>Columns with categorical value must end with the suffix "_C".</li>
<li>"file_name" should be updated inside the script according to your dataset after following the previous steps.</li>
<li>After completing the previous steps, the script can be run as a typical Python 3 script, and it should output the accuracy of the given dataset.</li>
</ol>
